# Passenger Satisfaction Analysis: Exploring Airline Travel Experiences using Python Libraries

<strong>For this project, I used a handy tool called the Pandas library in Python. It helped me manage and play around with the passenger satisfaction data. I could easily organize and filter the data to find out interesting stuff, like what made passengers happy or if certain factors influenced their satisfaction. 
With Pandas, I felt like I had a secret code to understand the data better. It made the whole project a lot simpler and enjoyable!

## Used Datasets

 ### Two key [datasets](https://github.com/datawithyounes/airline_python_exploratory_data_analysis/tree/main/csv) for this case study

- <strong>airline_passenger_satisfaction.csv</strong>: Customer satisfaction scores from 120,000+ airline passengers, including additional information about each passenger, their flight, and type of travel, as well as ther evaluation of different factors like cleanliness, comfort, service, and overall experience.

- <strong>data_dictionary.csv</strong>: A dictionnary explaining the data in each column.
