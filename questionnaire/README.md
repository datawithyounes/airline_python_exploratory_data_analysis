 # Python Airline Data Analysis Questions
 
### I have uploaded a PDF file with the questions I used in my Python Exploratory Data Analysis using Pandas.

1. How is passenger satisfaction distributed across different gender
groups?
2. Does age affect overall passenger satisfaction?
3. Are returning customers generally more satisfied than first-time
customers?
4. Is there a difference in satisfaction levels between business and
personal travelers?
5. Which travel class has the highest satisfaction rating?
6. Do longer flight distances have a direct effect on lower satisfaction
levels?
7. How do different aspects of the travel experience (e.g., cleanliness,
food, entertainment) contribute to overall satisfaction?
8. Is there a relationship between departure delay and passenger
satisfaction?

9. Does satisfaction with online services (booking, check-in,
boarding) impact overall satisfaction?
